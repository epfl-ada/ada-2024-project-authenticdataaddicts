## Title:

## Abstract: 
This project examines how lead actors' characteristics (height, ethnicity, gender, age) might influence a movie's success. By analyzing these traits across different genres, we aim to identify patterns linking specific actor attributes to successful movies. Data is gathered from CMU’s movie database, the IMDb non-commercial dataset, and Wikidata. Movie success is defined by two metrics: box office performance and critical reception. Since high-grossing movies may not always be well-received, and vice versa, separating performance from reception could yield to new insight. Ultimately, our goal is to determine how actor attributes influence a movie’s success, providing valuable insights for casting decisions and broader industry trends.

## Research questions:
- What correlation is there between a lead actor's physical and demographic characteristics and the success of the movie?
- Do the type of actors who star in critically aclaimed movies different than those who star in box office hits? 
- How does the genre of a movie influence our results? 
- Do the relationships between actor characteristics and movie success change depending on time period?

## Additional datasets:
In addition to the CMU dataset, we also used:
### [The IMDb non-commercial dataset (principles & ratings)](https://datasets.imdbws.com)
These two datasets give us the lead actors for each movie as well as critic ratings, respectively. 
### [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page)
By querying Wikidata, we can obtain a movie's IMDb and Freebase IDs, as well as box office earnings. Box office results can be used to supplement our main CMU dataset, and having a movie's associated IMDb and Freebase IDs allows us to more easily merge the IMDb dataset with the main dataset.
