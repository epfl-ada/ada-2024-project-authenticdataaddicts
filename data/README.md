The `actor_ethnicity.csv` file is the result of our API request to Wikidata. We chose to keep it in the repository because it's a small file and to avoid making unnecessary requests to the Wikidata API.

The `preprocessed` folder contains all of our preprocessed data. Since the files are small, we decided to include them in the repository to ensure we are working with the same data across different environments.
