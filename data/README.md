The `actor_ethnicity.csv` file is the result of our API request to Wikidata. We chose to keep it in the repository because it's a small file and to avoid making unnecessary requests to the Wikidata API.

The `inflation.csv` contains all the data about inflation. Since the website to get it is not really "fetching friendly" and the file is really small we decided to let it on the repo.

The `preprocessed` folder contains all of our preprocessed data. Since the files are small, we decided to include them in the repository to ensure we are working with the same data across different environments.

You can download all the necessary files locally in the Download datasets part of the notebook.
